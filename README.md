This bridge provides a file locator for the [Symfony Config component] that 
locates configuration files using a [Puli] repository. With this locator, you
can refer from one configuration file to another via its Puli path:

```yaml
# routing.yml
_acme_demo:
    resource: /acme/demo-bundle/config/routing.yml
```

Installation/Documentation
--------------------------

Follow the guide [Locating Config Files with Puli] to install the locator in
your project. This guide will tell you all you need to know to use the locator.
